  <div>


  <p class="center makeMeRed">My name is Lea Taylor-Kealy.  I am an artist with a passion for technology.  I started drawing at around the age of 14, primarily using plain pencils. <br> 
    Over the years my artistic interests have expanded to include the use of couloured pencils and markers and also the integration of technology with the<br>
    use of various virtual reality based art programmes, including cool paintr vr, Sculptr VR and Dreams, a game development engine for the playstation 4 which allows users to design all assets from graphical to musical and the logical operations required to make objects interactive.

    <p class="center makeMeRed">I developed an interest in coding and web development whilst in college, really enjoying the process of writing code, prefering to write all the code i needed<br>
    to use myself, as opposed to using web development software such as Dreamweaver or Microsoft Frontpage.  After college I attempted to further my understanding <br>
    of coding by signing myself up to an online course focused on c++, however this course lacked the support one would receive whilst studying in a classroom which,<br> 
    I feel is the most conducive environment for effective learning. However this course did provide me with a foundational understanding of the basics which served to<br>
    further my interest in the subject.</p>

   <p class="center makeMeRed"> Having spent a few years looking for a suitable opportunity to further my coding knowledge and to provide me with the framework needed to enter into the coding industry,<br>
    was made aware of code nation via an organisation whose goal is to help people develop the skills they need to enter the industry they would like to work in.  As soon <br>
    as I read the mission statement for Code Nation i realised that they were offering the exact opportunity I had been looking for.  Having completed the first week, <br>
    I am extremely grateful that a company such as this exists, the teaching methods are extremely effective.  Whereas I possessed no experience of Javascript a week ago,<br>
    I currently feel comfortable using all of the tools we have covered this week (loops, arrays, functions, if/else statements and dot notation).  When I compare what I <br>
    have learned in a week studying with code Nation to how little I grasped whilst pursuing the c++ course, I am confident that the decision to join code nation was the <br>
    correct one
