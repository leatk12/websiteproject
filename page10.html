    </div>

<div>
    <p class="center makeMeRed">Visual Studio Code, Trello and GitHub were the appropriate tools to accomplish my task.  Visual Studio Code was appropriate in that it is a more efficient means of creating a website than simply using a basic word processor such as wordpad or notepad.
            Trello was an appropriate tool as it allowed me to effectively plan out each step of the development of my website and keep track of what is in progress and what has been completed.
            GitHub was appropriate to use as it provided me a means of making my code publicly available and allowed me to access my code from anywhere, make changes to my code and then store said code back on Github as the most up to date version of my code.
