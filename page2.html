<h2 class="center makeMeWhite"><a name="Task1.2">Task 1.1 the purpose of IT in modern business </h2> 
</div>
<div>
    <p class="center makeMeWhite">IT has multiple purposes within modern business, ranging from the simple such as streamlining communication within the business as well as for both internal and external customers.  This can be communication via E-Mail or as technology has evolved it could include live chat systems, online meeting tools, voice over internet protocol (VOIP) telephones and smartphones.
            Additional advantages of incorporating IT within a business include Inventory Management Systems which allow businesses to automatically track stock levels, and keep track of when new stock is required.  There are also Data Management Systems which provide employees immediate access to files and documents which are stored on a business’ server.  Management Information Systems (MIS) enable companies to track various elements related to the business; performance.  Another aspect of IT which greatly benefits business are Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, which allow the business to capture every interaction with a customer in order to refine their practises and provide a more enriching experience for the customer.

            <h2 class="center makeMeWhite"><a href="Task1.2"></a>Task 1.2 Describe methods, skills and resources needed to complete projects successfully</h2>

            <p class="center makeMeWhite"> <a name="Task1.2">There are a variety of methods, skills and resources which will assist you in completing projects successfully.  An ability to communicate effectively and work collaboratively are two of the key skills required to complete any project successfully and efficiently.  Alongside these skills the ability to problem solve with an attention to detail combined with strong organisational skills and the ability to coordinate with a team are intrinsic in any successful project.
                    In regards to methods which contribute to a successful project I have come across two popular methodologies so far in my research; these are Waterfall methodologies and agile methodologies.
                    Waterfall methodologies - These are a more traditional, straightforward and sequential method of completing a project, requiring one thing to be completed before another thing can be started
                    Agile methodologies - This method embraces flexibility and collaboration to a much higher degree.  The agile approach allows teams to respond to change quickly and efficiently.  This allows the client to view the project at various stages of completion to ensure their expectations are being met before moving the project forward. [2]
                    The resources required for a successful project are quite varied.  They include the appropriate tools which can range from access to an appropriate compiler such as Visual Studio Code and a computer capable of handling the demands of developing the project, to external websites such as Moodlecloud, Stack, GitHub and Trello, which encourage and streamline your ability to work collaboratively.  Other resources necessary for a successful project include a 
                    system specification from the client, which will establish their needs in regards to the completed project, and a budget.  [3]</p>

                    <h2 class="center makeMeWhite">Task 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using it - E.G. Making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board</h2>

<p class="center makeMeWhite">
        I will plan out my website primarily using trello.com.  Trello.com allows users to create an extremely in-depth to do list to plan out tasks.  I have broken down my trello board into four headings; Things to do, Doing, Review and Done.
        Using the Things to do heading I will clearly list each task, allowing me to properly track my progress and prioritise tasks as needed.  Trello.com also allows me to plan the development of my website in small segments in relation to the overall whole.
        The Doing heading allows me to quickly make it clear to myself and anyone else with access to my trello board what I am currently working on, making collaboration much simpler.
        The Review heading is a stopgap where I place completed tasks that whilst completed require QA testing and the consideration of changes which could improve the overall quality of the task.  My Trello board can be found at https://trello.com/b/otAX77Kn/html-css-website-project.

<h2 class="center makeMeWhite">Task 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects - what causes digital projects to fail? why?</h2>
<p class="center makeMeWhite">
        One of the key risks with digital projects is the risk that the project will fail, according to my research between 70% and 90% of digital projects fail depending on the type of digital project in question.  A significant contributor towards failed digital projects is a lack of active collaboration.  However there are additional factors which contribute towards the failure of a project, I will address some of them here.
        Failing to account for business processes  - This can be the most significant barrier to the success of a digital project.  The problem tends to unfold as follows; Somebody notices a problem/inefficiency in how a company is delivering its product/service to the customer and proposes a digital solution that might help.  They then work to push that through, selling the project as the next step in customer-centricity.  However the tool/solution, while it does effectively solve the problem for the customer, doesn’t reflect or work well with the existing business process.
        Investing in cool gadgets not customer value - oftentimes projects that fail do so as  a result of investing in a cool gadget but not investing in business or customer value. Another potential cause of failed projects is unnecessarily focusing on a newly learned technique over established best practice, which can lead to unexpected difficulties further down the development pipeline.
        The tools one uses and the methods employed should always derive from a clearly defined project brief built around a defined business requirement or customer need.
        Poor definition /Expectations setting - A poorly defined project will inevitably be afflicted with scope creep, leading to unrealistic goals and expectations, which leads to excessive content being included in order to meet the unrealistic goals not properly elaborated on and defined in the planning process.
        Poor vendor selection - The most common problem when it comes to failed digital projects.  Poor vendor selection can jeopardise your project in a variety of ways beyond just their technical capabilities.  Smaller clients of vendors may find their work deprioritised in favour of a larger client.  On the opposite side of this problem is the selection of a vendor being under equipped to handle a client over a certain size or with specific requirements and thus struggling to service your account effectively.

<h2 class="center makeMeWhite">Task 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software - how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
<p class="center makeMeWhite">
                The technology I would use for this job would be, an apple mac pro as it is an extremely powerful device designed to make development a much easier and faster process, and considering the capabilities of the MacBook Pro it is relatively cheap in comparison considering the processing capabilities provided.  The MacBook Pro is also optimised for the development of IOS apps.  The software I would select is Visual Studio Code as this allows me to work in HTML, CSS and Javascript allowing me to seamlessly manage all aspects of the project from within.  I will also utilise a Trello board to keep track of the various jobs still needing completion.   I will also use GitHub to help keep track of my codes version control.
</p>
<br>

<h2 class="center makeMeWhite">Task 1.6  Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. - how trello helped you plan and how can GitHub help with your codes version control.</h2>
<p class="center makeMeWhite">
        Using Trello has allowed me to break my tasks down into separate chunks which allows me to more accurately track my progress and highlight any pressing tasks.  Using Trello I can track what tasks are yet to have begin, which tasks are currently being worked on, which tasks are complete and in need of review and which are entirely complete.
        GitHub allows me the opportunity to access the most up to date version of my code from anywhere whilst also making it available for others to view and potentially add to.

<h2 class="center makeMeWhite">Task 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects - How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
<p class="center makeMeWhite">
        The GDPR ( General Data Protection Regulation) is designed to protect the data of individuals, the regulation has a number of aims all designed to increase and standardise the protection of individuals including;
        Data portability - Individuals have a right to transfer their data from one service provider to another.  And it must happen in a commonly used and machine readable format.
        The right to be forgotten - If consumers are no longer customers, or if they withdraw their consent from a company to use their personal data, then they have the right to have their data deleted.
        The right to prevent profiling - 
        The right to object to processing, 
        The right to rectification and erasure 
        Subject access requests.
        Non-compliance with the GDPR can lead to the possibility of fines of 4% of turnover or up to $20 million or £16 million. [5]
        The GDPR outlines two important roles in the management and protection of data;
        Controller - An entity that decides the purpose and manner that data is or will be used.
        Processor - The person or group that processes the data on behalf of the controller.  Processing is obtaining, recording, adapting or holding personal data.
        Any data collected must be collected and used for the purpose laid out by the Data controller and for no longer than was specified when the data collection was implemented. [6]
