<div class="backgroundColor">
    <p class="center makeMeWhite">
        So far I am very happy with the tools selected for this task.  Visual Studio Code is a very versatile piece of software and is fit for purpose in regards to completion of this task.  Having both my HTML code, CSS code and external assets contained within the compiler makes the creation of a website much easier than had I used Wordpad or another similar software to write the  code.
        The Trello Board is another fantastic tool which has allowed me to track where I am up to.  Having a visual representation of the tasks you still have to do, what is currently in progress and what is completed makes managing a project much easier.
        GitHub has provided me the opportunity to edit my work from anywhere, and being able to save that work back to GitHub and access the updated code from the classroom makes taking your work home with you a far more intuitive process.

<h2 class="center makeMeWhite" id="tasktwotwo"><a name="Task2.2">Task 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>

<div class="backgroundColor">  <p class="center makeMeWhite">
    Visual Studio Code, Trello and GitHub were the appropriate tools to accomplish my task.  Visual Studio Code was appropriate in that it is a more efficient means of creating a website than simply using a basic word processor such as wordpad or notepad.
    Trello was an appropriate tool as it allowed me to effectively plan out each step of the development of my website and keep track of what is in progress and what has been completed.
    GitHub was appropriate to use as it provided me a means of making my code publicly available and allowed me to access my code from anywhere, make changes to my code and then store said code back on Github as the most up to date version of my code.

<h2 class="center makeMeWhite" id="tasktwothree"><a name="Task2.3">Task 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project - Are you happy with your website? Why? Why  not?  You should review it on the website itself in the interest of openness.  What would you change?</h2>
<div class="backgroundColor">
  <p class="center makeMeWhite"> 
    The primary strength of my website is that it accurately and concisely presents the information it was designed to.  It provides easy and clear navigation around the site to ensure a positive user experience.
    Overall I am happy with my website, given the currently limited range of my CSS knowledge, however there are a few things i would have preferred to add that were not essential to the completion of this project.  One change I would have liked to implement would have been to present the hyperlinks in a drop down menu.  For example if someone clicked on the Unit 1 task 1 drop down menu they would be presented with a list of links to the various tasks completed as part of Unit 1 Task 1.

<div class="backgroundColor">
  <p class="center makeMeWhite">
    The improvements I would like to make as mentioned before would be to redesign my navigation links so that the links for each task within a unit are in the relevant dropdown menu.  For example the primary links would be broken down into Unit 1 task 1, Unit 1 Task 2 etc.  Clicking on this would present the user with links to the various tasks related to unit 1 task 1.

<div class="backgroundColor">
  <p class="center makeMeWhite">
    I have used hyperlinks to link to a variety of content across my website.  I have linked to the official web pages of companies i have mentioned in my about me section.  I have also used hyperlinks to link to web pages I have used as a reference throughout my research.  I have also implemented jump links on each page of my website allowing users to jump to specific content on the page they are currently on.
    I also tested the features on my page to ensure they worked as expected and were fit to purpose.  I did this by using my website as if i was a user, clicking on all the links to ensure it has taken me to the correct page.  This could be a hyperlink which should take a user to another part of the website, or to content from another website.  I also tested that a video i had embedded was working correctly as I had some difficulties getting it to work correctly, and so refreshed the page multiple times just to ensure there were no unexpected surprises.
