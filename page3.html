            There are a variety of methods, skills and resources which will assist you in completing projects successfully.  An ability to communicate effectively and work collaboratively are two of the key skills required to complete any project successfully and efficiently.  Alongside these skills the ability to problem solve with an attention to detail combined with strong organisational skills and the ability to coordinate with a team are intrinsic in any successful project.
            In regards to methods which contribute to a successful project I have come across two popular methodologies so far in my research; these are Waterfall methodologies and agile methodologies.
            Waterfall methodologies - These are a more traditional, straightforward and sequential method of completing a project, requiring one thing to be completed before another thing can be started
            Agile methodologies - This method embraces flexibility and collaboration to a much higher degree.  The agile approach allows teams to respond to change quickly and efficiently.  This allows the client to view the project at various stages of completion to ensure their expectations are being met before moving the project forward. [2]
            The resources required for a successful project are quite varied.  They include the appropriate tools which can range from access to an appropriate compiler such as Visual Studio Code and a computer capable of handling the demands of developing the project, to external websites such as Moodlecloud, Stack, GitHub and Trello, which encourage and streamline your ability to work collaboratively.  Other resources necessary for a successful project include a system specification from the client, which will establish their needs in regards to the completed project, and a budget.  [3]
