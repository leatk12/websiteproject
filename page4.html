     <h2 class="center makeMeWhite">Task 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency - Could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h1>
 </div>
<div>
    <p class="center makeMeWhite">
            The only drawback I have identified in regards to the tools and systems used is my lack of experience using a MacBook Pro.  I feel this was the main hindrance in relation to my productivity and efficiency, being a Windows user.  I could have been more efficient by spending more time getting used to the operation of a MacBook Pro.  The benefits of using a MacBook Pro however do outweigh the negatives.  For example the built in terminal provides easy access to tools like Git.  Another tool which offered great benefit was my Trello board, it allowed me to break the various tasks into manageable chunks and keep track of which tasks are complete, in progress or need to be started.
            Another method of increasing productivity and efficiency would be to work as part of a team, splitting tasks between team members based on their competencies, so as to assign each team member based on the task best suited to them.

    <h2 class="center makeMeWhite">Task 3.2 describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h2>
<p class="center makeMeWhite">
        As previously mentioned the primary method I would use to maximise my productivity and efficiency would be to spend additional time learning the differences between the different tools and shortcuts between windows PC and Apple Macbook pros.
        Another method of improving both productivity and efficiency would be to spend more time in the design phase of my project.  Working as part of a team would also improve productivity and efficiency as it allows tasks to be assigned based on the teams competencies.  
        Another method i could use to improve productivity and efficiency would be to expand my understanding of CSS, a lot of time was spent attempting to resolve problems which arose from a lack of understanding and experience using CSS.  More time and practice with CSS would undoubtedly result in an increase in both productivity and efficiency.

<h2 class="center makeMeWhite">Task 3.3 Develop solutions to improve your own productivity using IT in digital projects -     What would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of slack.</h2>
<p class="center makeMeWhite">
        For my next project I would definitely spend a lot more time in the design phase, however I do recognise that the creative design side of these tasks are my primary weak point.  As such I feel that any future project would be best served as part of a team where I can discuss and plan the project alongside someone with more creative tendencies.  I could also increase productivity by using Slack to share code in order to experiment with potential solutions I may not have thought of myself, or to discuss possible problems with code amongst a group of people thus increasingly the likelihood of quickly identifying and solving any problems in the code.

<br>
<h2 class="center makeMeWhite">Task 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
<p class="center makeMeWhite">
        The process i would follow to test my website would be to firstly to identify any pre-existing issues i had noticed during the development process and have not been able to resolve.  The next step would be to attempt to identify any issues i may have missed, an example being a hyperlink linking to the wrong page.  Once I have identified and logged the issues i will then proceed to attempt to resolve these issues.  Once this is completed I will ask someone else to go through my website and attempt to identify any mistakes/errors etc that i may have missed or that may have arisen from my attempts to resolve prior errors.  I will then repeat this process until i am happy that any issues have been resolved
