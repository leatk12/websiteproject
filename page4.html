            The only drawback I have identified in regards to the tools and systems used is my lack of experience using a MacBook Pro.  I feel this was the main hindrance in relation to my productivity and efficiency, being a Windows user.  I could have been more efficient by spending more time getting used to the operation of a MacBook Pro.  The benefits of using a MacBook Pro however do outweigh the negatives.  For example the built in terminal provides easy access to tools like Git.  Another tool which offered great benefit was my Trello board, it allowed me to break the various tasks into manageable chunks and keep track of which tasks are complete, in progress or need to be started.
            Another method of increasing productivity and efficiency would be to work as part of a team, splitting tasks between team members based on their competencies, so as to assign each team member based on the task best suited to them.
