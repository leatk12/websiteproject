    <p class="makeMeRed">I will plan out my website primarily using trello.com.  Trello.com allows users to create an extremely in-depth to do list to plan out tasks.  I have broken down my trello board into four headings; Things to do, Doing, Review and Done.
            Using the Things to do heading I will clearly list each task, allowing me to properly track my progress and prioritise tasks as needed.  Trello.com also allows me to plan the development of my website in small segments in relation to the overall whole.
            The Doing heading allows me to quickly make it clear to myself and anyone else with access to my trello board what I am currently working on, making collaboration much simpler.
            The Review heading is a stopgap where I place completed tasks that whilst completed require QA testing and the consideration of changes which could improve the overall quality of the task.  My Trello board can be found at<a href="https://trello.com/b/otAX77Kn/html-css-website-project.">https://trello.com/b/otAX77Kn/html-css-website-project.</a>"
