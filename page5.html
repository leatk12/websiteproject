        My web pages will be laid out with the hyperlinks along the top, a clear H1 heading for the about me page and then H2 headings for each task.  The background of the website for each page will be a gif image with the text contained in opaque text boxes with a purple colour in order to match the background.  The text will all be white with the exception of hyperlinks which i have given varying colours based on the status of the link (clicked, unclicked etc) and placed in flex boxes.  I have located any references I have used at the bottom of the page for which they have been cited alongside a numerical value so that users can distinguish which reference was used for what task.

        In regards to the content of my site my About me page will have a brief overview of myself and what led me here. I will also include some examples of my artwork a the bottom of the page.  The pages of my site relating to the varying tasks will be broken up into separate pages with the headings; Unit 1 Task 1, Unit 1 Task 2, Unit 1 Task 3 and Unit 2 Task 1, with each page having hyperlinks at the top of the page that allows the user to jump down the page to specific content.

 <h2 class="center makeMeWhite" id="u2taskonefive"><a name="Task1.5">Task 1.5 Describe copyright and other constraints affecting websites
        </h2>
       <div class="backgroundColor">
        <p class="center makeMeWhite">Copyright refers to the legal protection of original works of authorship.  This includes literary, written, dramatic, artistic, musical and other types of creative expression.  Any website hosted in the UK has to adhere to the copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.  There is also a supplemental law known as the copyright (Computer Programs) Regulations 1992 which extends copyright protections to software.
                In the UK original works of intellectual property are protected upon creation, meaning as soon as you post your website, you enjoy copyright protection.  However the U.K. Copyright Service highly recommends registration because websites are subject to abuse and that process allows a civil cause of action.
                As previously mentioned, copyright protection is effective as soon as you post your website.  To remind users of this protection, many websites add copyright notices to the footer.
                Since new content on a website technically requires additional registration, many developers place a range of years on their website to cover all past and current content.
                Developers who create sites for other entities may retain their copyright protections, especially if they maintain their own graphics libraries and staff copywriters.  The websites footer will have the contractors name in these cases. 
                Websites are especially vulnerable to copyright infringement in the sense that any image on the website is a single right click and “save as” away from being infringed upon, or a copy and paste in regards to text based content.  As such you should always be prepared to face possible infringement.  <a href="#refseven">[7]</a>
                Some other constraints affecting websites are the variety of viewports used to view websites.  Users utilise a variety of different sized screens, this consideration should always be considered when designing and building your website, how does it appear on a mobile phone screen? How does it appear on a standard 17” monitor? How does it appear when disp[layed on a wall sized screen.
                Another constraint of web design is the fact that web users can and do zoom in and out as they interact with a web page, changing the size of text and images, as such you should always consider how different browsing environments handle zoom differently. <a href="#refeight">[8]</a>

 <div class="backgroundColor">
                    <p class="center makeMeWhite">
        There are a variety of issues pertaining to users with disabilities that you should take into account when designing and building your website.
        Some of the issues that we should consider are as follows;
        Auditory disabilities - This can range from partial hearing loss to complete deafness.  If you have any audio features on your website you should take steps to integrate some form of closed captions into the feature. 
        Speech disabilities - Some people may have difficulties producing speech that is recognisable by others or by voice recognition software.  As such you should ensure that there is an option to perform the same task via text, to ensure equality of opportunity for users with a speech related disability. [11]

 <h2 class="center makeMeWhite" id="u2taskoneseven"><a name="Task1.7"></a>Task 1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites</h2>
 <div class="backgroundColor">
 <p class="center makeMeWhite">
        The file types I have utilised for this project are .HTML and .CSS. 
        .CSS is the file extension for the Cascading Style Sheet, this can be used to format the layout of a web page. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, they can be used to define text files, table sizes and various other aspects of a web page.  CSS is also helpful in regards to formatting other aspects of the web page layout, being used to define the cell padding around images and/or other objects. CSS gives developer more control over how their web pages will look than HTML provides, which is why most web pages today incorporate Cascading style sheets. <a href="#refnine">[9]</a>
        .HTML is the file extension for the HyperText Markup Language.  HTML consists of a series of short codes typed into a text file by the site author - these are the tags.  The text is then saved as a HTML file, and viewed through a web browser.  The browser reads the file and translates the text into a visible form.
        The tags in HTML are what separate normal text from HTML code.  The HTML tags tell your browser what to render on the page, different tags will perform different functions.  The tags themselves do not appear when you view your page through a browser, but their effects do. <a href="#reften">[10]</a>
