   <p class="center makeMeRed">One of the key risks with digital projects is the risk that the project will fail, according to my research between 70% and 90% of digital projects fail depending on the type of digital project in question.  A significant contributor towards failed digital projects is a lack of active collaboration.  However there are additional factors which contribute towards the failure of a project, I will address some of them here.
        Failing to account for business processes  - This can be the most significant barrier to the success of a digital project.  The problem tends to unfold as follows; Somebody notices a problem/inefficiency in how a company is delivering its product/service to the customer and proposes a digital solution that might help.  They then work to push that through, selling the project as the next step in customer-centricity.  However the tool/solution, while it does effectively solve the problem for the customer, doesnâ€™t reflect or work well with the existing business process.
        Investing in cool gadgets not customer value - oftentimes projects that fail do so as  a result of investing in a cool gadget but not investing in business or customer value. Another potential cause of failed projects is unnecessarily focusing on a newly learned technique over established best practice, which can lead to unexpected difficulties further down the development pipeline.
        The tools one uses and the methods employed should always derive from a clearly defined project brief built around a defined business requirement or customer need.
        Poor definition /Expectations setting - A poorly defined project will inevitably be afflicted with scope creep, leading to unrealistic goals and expectations, which leads to excessive content being included in order to meet the unrealistic goals not properly elaborated on and defined in the planning process.
        Poor vendor selection - The most common problem when it comes to failed digital projects.  Poor vendor selection can jeopardise your project in a variety of ways beyond just their technical capabilities.  Smaller clients of vendors may find their work deprioritised in favour of a larger client.  On the opposite side of this problem is the selection of a vendor being under equipped to handle a client over a certain size or with specific requirements and thus struggling to service your account effectively.[4]
