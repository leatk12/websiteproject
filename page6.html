        <p class=" center makeMeRed">The technology I would use for this job would be, an apple mac pro and the software would be Visual Studio Code as this allows me to work in HTML, CSS and Javascript allowing me to seamlessly manage all aspects of the project from within.  I will also utilise a Trello board to keep track of the various jobs still needing completion.   I will also use GitHub to help keep track of my codes version control.
