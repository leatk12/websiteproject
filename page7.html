                Using Trello has allowed me to break my tasks down into separate chunks which allows me to more accurately track my progress and highlight any pressing tasks.  Using Trello I can track what tasks are yet to have begin, which tasks are currently being worked on, which tasks are complete and in need of review and which are entirely complete.
                GitHub allows me the opportunity to access the most up to date version of my code from anywhere whilst also making it available for others to view and potentially add to.
