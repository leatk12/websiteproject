        <p class="center makeMeRed">The GDPR ( General Data Protection Regulation) is designed to protect the data of individuals, the regulation has a number of aims all designed to increase and standardise the protection of individuals including;
                Data portability - Individuals have a right to transfer their data from one service provider to another.  And it must happen in a commonly used and machine readable format.
                The right to be forgotten - If consumers are no longer customers, or if they withdraw their consent from a company to use their personal data, then they have the right to have their data deleted.
                The right to prevent profiling - 
                The right to object to processing, 
                The right to rectification and erasure 
                Subject access requests.
                Non-compliance with the GDPR can lead to the possibility of fines of 4% of turnover or up to $20 million or Â£16 million. [5]
                The GDPR outlines two important roles in the management and protection of data;
                Controller - An entity that decides the purpose and manner that data is or will be used.
                Processor - The person or group that processes the data on behalf of the controller.  Processing is obtaining, recording, adapting or holding personal data.
                Any data collected must be collected and used for the purpose laid out by the Data controller and for no longer than was specified when the data collection was implemented. [6]
