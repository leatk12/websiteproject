    <h1 class="center makeMeRed">Task 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.</h1>

<p class="center makeMeRed">
        So far I am very happy with the tools selected for this task.  Visual Studio Code is a very versatile piece of software and is fit for purpose in regards to completion of this task.  Having both my HTML code, CSS code and external assets contained within the compiler makes the creation of a website much easier than had I used Wordpad or another similar software to write the  code.
        The Trello Board is another fantastic tool which has allowed me to track where I am up to.  Having a visual representation of the tasks you still have to do, what is currently in progress and what is completed makes managing a project much easier.
        GitHub has provided me the opportunity to edit my work from anywhere, and being able to save that work back to GitHub and access the updated code from the classroom makes taking your work home with you a far more intuitive process.
